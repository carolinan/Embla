== Important Notes ==
The main menu supports 3 levels, while the social menu supports one level.

 When using the templates, Gutenberg "Cover images" will always be in full width. 
 This is because the width and alignment settings for the Cover images have not yet been implemented in Gutenberg (2017-12-06).
 ** Wide images -Use this template with wide or full width images. 
   This template removes the border, shadow, and background color around the content, since this was interupting the flow and feel of the page.
 ** Blank -Use this template if you only want to show your Gutenberg blocks. Does not show the header, footer, footer widget area or post navigation.
